Hello! Thank you for taking the time to review our code prototype for our Fanatasy RPG game! We have 
big ideas for this project and we look forward to continuing to work on it! 
	
	Here is what the demo can do at this time:
		- Allow the player to pick the Rogue character class.
		- Once class is picked the character is given Rogue armor and weapon along with potions.
		- Randomly generate a mob for the player to fight.
		- Combat with the mob. (No mana management at this time)
		- Player can display inventory. (No use command for inventory at this time)
		- Player can pick attack skills to use against the mob in combat.
			- NOTE: must type out skill name exactly the way it is displayed in order to use.
		- Player can "inspect" mobs and receive unique descriptions of each mob.
		- Player can attempt to flee the combat encounter.
		
At this time, the game can only be run in the eclipse console. For a retro experience, set your eclipse
console to have a black background with green text.

We hope you enjoy the demo and we look forward to your creative feedback!

Sincerely,
	The SEMI;_Bandits (The Text-Based RPG Team)
